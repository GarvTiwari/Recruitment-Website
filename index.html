    <p class="data"> Nowadays recruitment software has to meet many requirements. Whenever a company decides to select a new system there are different groups of interest involved: e.g. recruiters, business managers, IT and management departments. Therefore software manufacturers often see themselves confronted with complex requests and specification sheets that hardly any system can fulfill within a reasonable budget range. So exactly which qualities does an e-recruitment system have to possess to enable the recruiters and business managers to work efficiently?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="data extra">1. User Friendly</p>
    <p class="data">A recruitment system is a complex application that has to be intuitive for the users. The handling has to be clear with a logical allocation of the functionalities in order to increase the user acceptance and productivity. The use of modern web technologies in the software architecture is a precondition, too.</p>
    <br>


    <p class="data extra">2.  Web-based</p>
    <p class="data">In any case, an up-to-date system should be web-based. Whereas it doesn’t really matter whether the data is hosted on a server of the client (On premise) or of the supplier (SaaS/Software as a service). The access of all employees to a centralized database enables the usage from different locations. The software can then also be maintained and updated more regularly.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">3. Multi-Channel-Posting</p>
    <p class="data">One of the recruiters’ main activities is the publishing of job offers on various online job portals to obtain the maximum reach. The central handling of the job board logins directly from the system makes the function of multi-channel-posting easy-to-handle and helps to save precious time.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">4. CV Parsing</p>
    <p class="data">CV parsing is the automatic scanning of candidate data. Applications can be directly extracted, modified and evaluated. Like this the HR employees gain lots of time when inserting data. Furthermore the number of errors resulting from the manual insertion decreases.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">5. Matching</p>
    <p class="data">The matching between the candidates and the customers’ needs is one of the essential processes for engineering services. It is crucial that the relevant competencies are recognized and considered within the search. A dynamic catalogue of competences that contains different specific keywords as well as synonyms and other spellings and other translations can bring a major advantage.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">6. Talent pool</p>
    <p class="data">Any position can be staffed with only one candidate. Though this does not necessarily imply that the other applicants do not represent precious human capital. In times where you have to talk about the “war of talents” with a decreasing number of candidates for the number of jobs to be staffed this potential should not be given away with a negative answer. Instead you can transfer them into a talent pool – with their consent, of course. Like this they can be reconsidered for later vacancies. Here it makes sense to use the recruitment software rather like a CRM to establish a regular contact with the pool members.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">7. CRM</p>
    <p class="data">Recruitment usually starts with a staffing need whether it is internal or external, i.e. for a client. If the engineering services are able to cover their own recruitment processes with the tool, the same should go for their customer relationships. In fact the contact and exchange with the client is equally important since the recruitment is being done for him. The recruiter can receive required profiles and offer candidates with the desired competencies directly through the CRM to make their work easier.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="data extra">8. Monitoring</p>
    <p class="data">In order to manage a company precisely you need to know about certain KPIs, especially within the core business areas of an engineering service, i.e. recruitment and sales. The e-recruitment system can support this with clearly structured reportings. Like this, you can easily understand how many applications were received, how many client interviews resulted from this and how many projects were won in the end.</p>
